## What Day App

## Description 
The "What Day" app allows users to input a calendar date and returns the corresponding day of the week for that date. The app checks for invalid inputs, such as out-of-range dates, non-numeric formats, and incorrect dates like February 29 in a non-leap year. The app provides clear error messages, guiding users to correct any mistakes in the input.
